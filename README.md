Hi! I am Lolla Aditya Srivatsav👋🏻😀, currently pursuing my Master’s in Data Science at the University at Buffalo. I’m honing my skills in Python, R with a focus on machine learning optimization, multi-task learning, and deep learning concepts such as gradient descent and catastrophic forgetting. 
Previously, as a Full-Stack Web Developer at Evoke Technologies, I specialized in providing bespoke services for Law and Financial firms, with expertise in Python, C#, OOPS, Web API, SQL, and IoT Design. 
I’m passionate about collaborating on projects related to deep learning and full-stack development, and I’m always eager to work on innovative and impactful AI models. 
Feel free to reach out to me via email or connect with me on LinkedIn. Fun fact: I enjoy exploring the intersection of AI and IoT.
